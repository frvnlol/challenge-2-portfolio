# Week 2 Challenge: Portfolio

## Description

This is a portfolio created through HTML and CSS to provide future employers a quick insight on who I am, what I have accomplished, and how to contact me.

This webpage gives employers exactly what they need to see and for me to display why I am a good candidate for the job. 

With this project, I have a better understanding of sizing and positioning for everything on a webpage. Also understanding what it means to create responsive web design for anyone visiting the page on a different device or even just resizing their window on a computer screen.
